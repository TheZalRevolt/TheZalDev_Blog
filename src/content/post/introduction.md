Welcome to my blog! My name is Riccardo aka TheZal, a passionate developer who wants to always learn about the dev world!

Here I write about dev things, tech things and what I learn, hoping that this blog push me to always learn something new.

Currently, I am a software engineer @[Revolt](https://www.revoltsrl.it/), a company specialized in data analysis and data integration. I mainly work in the architectural and backend domains.

My stack is mainly composed of .NET and Python, but as I mentioned before, I am trying to learn new things by studying new technologies (such as Astro, which is used for this blog) and Blazor.
In the past, I have worked with Angular, but I do not consider myself a developer with Angular in my frontend arsenal.

Besides this, I am an open-source enthusiast and believe in the principles of software craftsmanship. I strongly believe in the quality of code.

Apart from this, I am a lover of American comics, US sports, and a player of Dungeons and Dragons!
