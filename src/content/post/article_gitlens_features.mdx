## What is GitLens?

GitLens is a [powerful](https://media.tenor.com/H5e3t_U9D4oAAAAC/unlimited-power-star-wars.gif) visual studio code extension that allows everyone who is using it to improve the quality of their work.

There are many features, some are available for free and some other are included in the GitLens+ plan. I use the free plan and I can say that just with this plan the use of vscode is really improved.

I'm gonna break down a list of what I think the use of GitLens easily improve and I'll try to motivate that in few words: let's get started!

## Focus!

When it comes to software development, staying focused is key to getting things done smoothly and efficiently. And that's where GitLens comes in! It's a game-changer for me. With GitLens, I can easily keep track of important code changes and see who worked on what, without getting distracted by switching contexts.

GitLens has some awesome features that really level up your Git experience. You get inline blame annotations and CodeLens, which give you deeper insights into how your code has changed and who made those changes, you can even toggle on-demand annotations for the whole file, which gives you a detailed breakdown of recent changes and a cool heatmap showing you which lines have been modified recently!

Navigating through file revisions becomes a breeze with GitLens. You can dive into the history of a file and see how the code has evolved over time, gaining valuable insights into its progression and here's the best part: GitLens has a status bar blame feature that quickly tells you who made changes to the current line and when, all without interrupting your workflow. It keeps the info you need right at your fingertips.

To make your Git workflow even smoother, GitLens has a handy Git command palette that guides you through common Git commands, so you don't have to juggle different contexts or remember complicated command-line options.

And let's not forget about the awesome commit search functionality in GitLens: you can easily search and explore commit histories based on different criteria like commit messages, authors, specific file changes, and more. It's a powerful way to navigate and investigate the evolution of your codebase.

In a nutshell, GitLens is a must-have tool for developers who want to stay focused. It helps you zoom in on important changes, track code authorship effortlessly, and minimize any distractions caused by context switching. With GitLens, you can unlock the full potential of Git and ensure a seamless and productive software development experience. üöÄ‚ú®
